-----------------------------------

Admin commands:

<b>default pillory [amount] spice</b>

<b>default pillory [time] [mins/hrs/days]</b>
(sets the group default pillory time. minimum of 5 for mins, and 1 for hrs & days)

<b>set pillory @username [amount] spice</b> 
(sets the amount required to pillory that user)

<b>unmute @username</b> 
(unmute user override without payment. rains the unmuted payment if there is any.)

<b>pillory [on/off]</b>
(enable or disable pillory feature in a group)

-----------------------------------

General (public) pillory commands:

<b>pillory list</b>
(shows those who have money thrown towards them to be muted)

<b>mute list</b>
(shows users currently muted and remaining time)

<b>default pillory fee</b>
(see the default pillory cost for the group)

<b>default pillory time</b>
(see the default pillory time for the group)

<b>pillory @username [amount] spice</b>

{UNMUTE_EMOJIS}
